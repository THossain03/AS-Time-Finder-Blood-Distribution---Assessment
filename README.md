# AS-Time-Finder-Blood-Distribution---Assessment

Hi there, there are two different problems here: one is a machine which finds and locates the number of times a 12-hr formatted time has its digit written as a arithmetic sequence (since a 12 am startpoint), while another calculates for a maximum production in serving a specified number of blood units to patients in need.
The Arithmetic Sequence determiner was implemented using mainly PHP, while also HTML/CSS to give it a mini-web like vibe. 
The blood distribution algorithm was coded using C++, implementing concepts like vector containers, nested loops, and input streaming libraries of C++.
Hope this code is easily accessible and executable, and thanks for taking the time to view the code.
