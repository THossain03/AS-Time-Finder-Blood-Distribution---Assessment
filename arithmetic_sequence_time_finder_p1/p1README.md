General Acesss Instructions:
I usually integrate PHP combined with HTML/CSS/JS using the XAMPP localhosting web server. I would say it is best to have that installed to run and access this program directly.

General Problem Description:
This is an algorithm that determines the number of arithmetic sequences that appear between the digits of a 12-hr format timestamp  starting between 12:00 to a specific amount of minutes after 12:00. This "specific amount of minutes" will be determined by you as the user.General input restriction is that the number has to be an integer and between 0 to 1000000000. 

Other Notes:
I implemented this code with php and html/css mainly through the index.php and index.css files. I decided for this portion I wanted to implement HTML displays and output through HTML elements as well. I did later think it might have just been easier to just do file streaming directly, but hopefully this is a feasible alternative (as HTML implementation is stated OK in the original description).

Also, Feel free to easily check out some of the png images in this folder too showing screenshots of how the program in the site runs and calculates the number of arithmetic sequences successfully. 
(The three screenshots are for j4.01, j4.02, j4.03 test cases respectively).
